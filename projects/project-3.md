This project was an assignment from ics 212. In this class we foused on programming in C and C++. 

The project is a database with user interaction, where a person sees a bunch of options on the terminal and can choose options such as adding, deleting, and even reversing the order of the data. 

The purpose of this project was actually to change code from one language to another. Originally this program was coded in C language, and this was one of the first times that I had to convert code to another language. At first I thought it was going to be really hard, but surprisingly most of my code had minor changes, where the changes were just syntax changes like printing output for the reader.
