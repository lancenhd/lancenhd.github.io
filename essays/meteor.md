   Throughout this period of about three weeks I have been interacting and learning about
   meteor through video tutorials and homework assignments. And through this experience, I feel 
   that meteor is complex and I have had some problems with it. 
   
   Meteor is very complex. To make a website with a basic structure of adding stuff, 
   editing stuff, saving stuff, and deleting stuff, I had to go through so much files and folders. 
   It feels like a juggling act, where you must remember to keep track of where everything is, otherwise
   everything falls. Some things that may lead to this is forgetting to import a file into your index of one of your folders. 
   This small problem messed up my site and left me spending hours looking through code, and even redoing the videos to see
   what exactly I missed. There were also many files that I don't touch, but are there to make the website run, all I know is
   that I shouldn't touch them because, if I do my localhost website will crash.
   
   Besides the amount of files in meteor, similar to maybe java. There is things with running meteor. Originally, I wrote in 
   another essay that I didn't have any problems with meteor. Well, I was wrong, because as soon as I wrote that I started 
   having problems with runnning meteor. Some of it I feel was a problem with the way I was using git to manage my work, and 
   perhaps a mixture of intelij. However, the only way I got around it was doing it from scratch. 
   
   However, besides these difficulties that I faced. I think meteor is cool, and I want to understand it more. Especially,
   since I am interested in making a website and I will be using meteor for the final project. The only thing though, 
   is that in class, we haven't gone over actually putting a website out there. Which is something I will look into.
