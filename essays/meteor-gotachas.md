  It has been 2 weeks since using meteor, and although I have heard in class that several people have been encountering problems with using meteor, nothing hindering has happened to me yet. 
  However, there are few instances that I have a warnings when meteor is running for me, like when I try to run meteor so it can create a local host web page. On my terminal I get a lot of warnings because I'm running pure javascript, and it says that my program will run 3 times slower. Or recently after accidently deleting one of my homework assignments called "digits" by using rm -rf through command line I tried to redo the homework by cloning a previous save on my github. However, when I used meteor run, it wouldn't run because some files were corrupted or something. So, I rebooted my computer and everything was back to normal, however when I reload my localhost page, I would read in the terminal that there is no local default user. Yet, everything seems to be working normally, or at least normal enough to keep up with the class work. 
   However besides talking about errors and warnings, I think meteor in general is pretty interesting and challenging. I say this because there is a lot of files in meteor to work with. Like sometimes it seems really redundant, and I feel I would totally be lost if there wasn't all these video tutorials and guides to help me out.
