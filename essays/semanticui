This past week I learned about semantic ui. In summary I felt like it was like a premade item that helps format and stylize html and css.
This trims the time of coders, allowing them to better create web pages at a faster pace. However one may ask, what do you mean by making websites faster?

By faster, I mean you don’t have to write everything from scratch. Plus, a big thing about html and css is the spacing and placing
items into certain areas, which can be kind of tricky.  With semantic ui, you have code that is written for you, where you just swap out minor things such as names
of elements for things that you want to put in for the website. Such as names of categories in menus or information about headers, or even images.
Semantic ui basically is almost like a cookie cutter sort of thing, with a lot of copy and paste. 

However, although semantic ui can speed up the time of making a website, the most difficult part is looking for the information.
The information is there, it’s just that you have to know what you are looking for and where it is, like looking for icons. This of course is can be solved
from practicing using semantic ui and by actually reading through it’s documentation which although has a lot of documentation is neatly categorized.

Overall, I thought semantic ui was great and speeds up the time for making a website, especially look nice, and I plan to use it in the future to make other website.
