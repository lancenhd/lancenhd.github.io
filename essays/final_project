## Overview 

### The Problem 

College students want to play and discuss games with other people, but don't have the time and have difficulaty finding people that have similar interests.

### The Solution

Create an app that allows users to come together and find other people who go to UH to play and hang out with, either in person or online. Each user will have their own page where they can set their game preferences, and find others who have similar preferences. The web app might have pages for major games as a sort of hub of sorts for gamers at UH to create a community for that game.

## Mockup Pages Ideas

- User Homepage
- Login Page
- Admin/Moderator Homepage
- User Profile Page
- List of Games with sublist of players for each game

## Use Case Idea

- New User comes to homepage, logs in, sets up profile, and goes to homepage.
- Admin goes to homepage, log in, and goes to admin/moderator homepage.
- User goes to homepage, logs in, and comes back to homepage, and then goes to list of games, chooses a game (let's say League of Legends) and opens a chat channel of League players.
- User is notified by chat channel or DMs and responds.

## Beyond the Basics

- Text message notifications. See notifications and can reply for response. 
- Discord + Steam integration.
- Rating system of popular games.
