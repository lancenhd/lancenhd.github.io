This week's focus was on coding standards. Based on my experience with using ES Lint to follow 
a coding standard for JavaScript, I found it a little troublesome. At first, I thought I had no 
problems. I was writing code like I usually do, which I thought looked nice and understandable. 
Something like:
    Function something(nums)
    {
       let i = 0;
       if(nums + i > 0)
       {
         console.log("Cool");
       }
       else 
       {
         console.log("Other word");
       }
    }
    
    console.log(something(9));
    
But after actually installing and using ES Lint, I had loads of errors and couldn't run my code.
Which was frustrating because I didn't want to write another way for it to be correct. Like, the 
code could be the same, but just being spaced weirdly made it wrong. 

However, although I didn't really like these rule binding code standards, I can see the importance of it. 
Having people write the same way can help fix problems. It's like looking at patterns, and if a person 
can figure out a pattern, then it would be easier to solve a problem. This would especially be helpful 
when working with people, which seems very likely in the real world. There will also be many projects 
that have existing code, and if people didn't find a standard way to write the code, it would be 
even harder for you or the new person working on the project.

Also I have experienced a change in my own coding style before this class. When learning C, my teacher 
introduced a new way of formating my code. I liked it because of the amount of white space, which is 
something I noticed a lot of JavaScript code has less of. 

Anyway, overall although I didn't really like ESLint, I can why it is important. It is so people can better 
understand each others work, and to better make use of one's time.
